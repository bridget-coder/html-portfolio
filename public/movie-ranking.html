<h3>Extraction 1</h3>
<p>As the name implies, the movie is about an extraction. A boy is kidnapped and an ex-soldier is contacted for the rescue and he risks his life for a child he knows nothing about. This movie will spark feelings of care, put you on the edge of your seat with the unending action, betrayal, shocking turnarounds.</p>

<h3>Heart of Stone</h3>
<p>This movie is filled with sacrifices, trust, pretence, betrayal, action that will haave you wanting more.</p>

<h3>Bad Boys Ride or Die</h3>
<p>If you're a fan of crazy driving, weddings, bold steps, spontaneous actions, then you'll love Bad Boys. This movie is about two friends that have been together for God knows how long. One is long married while the other is joining the marriage train.</p>
